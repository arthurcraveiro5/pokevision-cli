# (Unofficial) PokéVision CLI

This tool allows you to talk directly to the PokéVision API servers. Right now there is only one command - `pokevision watch`, which monitors the coordinates provided for new Pokémon, and logs their location & expiration time.

## Features

- Periodically checks the PokéVision API for new Pokémon
- Push updates to a Slack channel ([howto](./docs/slack-notifications.md))
- No dependencies, lightweight & simple
- Desktop notifications ([howto](./docs/desktop-notifications.md))
- Multi-language Pokémon names ([howto](./docs/languages.md))
- Filtering in/out specific Pokémon ([howto](./docs/filters.md))

## Getting Started

Check out the [docs](./docs/readme.md) for [installation instructions](./docs/installation.md) and [basic usage](./docs/basic-usage.md).
